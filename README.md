# Top Influencer Instagram Data Exploration
## Why was I Interested?
I chose to explore data from top Instagram influencers because it can give me valuable insights into the complex and intriguing world of social media marketing. Instagram is a major player in influencer engagement, making it a perfect platform to study how influencers strategically navigate and leverage their online powers. People often use the Instagram network to influence their followers in a certain way on specific issues, and this influence can impact things in various ways. So which factors most heavily determine how impactful a top influencer can be? The goal of my analysis is to uncover the main factors that have the greatest impact on how influential an influencer becomes. By doing so, I hoped to provide marketers and social media enthusiasts with valuable knowledge that can help them make informed decisions when using influencers in their digital marketing. Knowing which influencers to partner with can help make big changes because these people have a lot of power in their hands.

Questions that my project tries to answer:
1.  How does the number of followers correlate with the influence score?
2.  What are the top 10 countries in terms of the number of top influencers?
3.  Which influencers have the highest influence score but relatively fewer followers? Does the number of followers determine how impactful you are?
4.  Which ten influencers have the highest growth in average likes on new posts compared to their overall average?
5.  Why would it be important to look at the highest growth in average likes on new posts compared to their overall average?
6.  How do the top ten influencers by rank differ in terms of their average post likes and total followers?
7.  Are there countries where social media activity is particularly high or low?
8.  Does the number of followers affect the amount of likes an influencer gets?
9.  Which country has the highest average influence score?
10. Does the number of posts have an effect on the influence score?
11. How does the engagement on new posts compare to the overall average engagement?
